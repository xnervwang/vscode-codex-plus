/*
 * Compares element screenshots with an approved copy per platform, in test/vscode/baseline/<platform>/<name>.png. Only
 * what this extension draws is cropped, never Codex's or VS Code's own parts, which change with their releases.
 *
 * Every crop is written to <out>/actual/<platform>/<name>.png. With no approved copy for this platform the crop is only
 * saved, and the run prints a note saying so; update-baseline.js turns a run's crops into the approved copies. With one,
 * the two are compared pixel by pixel: a pixel differs when one of its channels is off by more than TOLERANCE.channel,
 * and the crop fails when more than TOLERANCE.share of its pixels differ. A failure writes
 * <out>/diff/<platform>/<name>.png, the approved copy dimmed with the differing pixels in red.
 *
 * Two runs on one machine drew every crop the same, but for a few pixels of one submenu off by a single level, and the
 * time stamps the masks leave out. Another machine of the same platform can place anti-aliasing a little differently.
 * A channel off by more than 32 of 255 is past that and short of any change of colour a reader would see; 0.2 per cent
 * of a 227 by 156 px menu is 70 px, about one letter. A crop of another size than the approved copy fails on its own,
 * unless it is one pixel off: an element 258.5 px tall is drawn 259 px tall where its top lands on a whole pixel and
 * 258 px where it lands on a half, and how far down a menu opens moves by half pixels from run to run. A crop whose
 * width or height differs from the approved copy's by one pixel is compared on the part both have, from the top left.
 *
 * `masks` are rectangles of the crop, { x, y, w, h }, that are not compared: time stamps.
